# PRICE APP

This is a simple python GUI app based on Tkinter that was developed for **storing products** and its **prices** from different buy locations. It was developed for personal use.

Reason for its small window size is that it was developed for use on my android phone.

## Requirements

You need to have **python** installed on your device in order to run this app. You also have to install **Pillow** package for python. In order to install it, just run this in your console:

```bash
pip install Pillow
```

or if you are on MacOS or Linux:

```bash
pip3 install Pillow
```

Requirements can also be installed using **pipenv**.

## Creating Database

Database was not included because mine is populated with my products and prices. In order to create database run `db/db_create.py` in python.

## Running app

Just run `price_app.py` in python. Everything else is self explanatory. Enjoy!
